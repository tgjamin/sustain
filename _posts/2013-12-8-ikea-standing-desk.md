I've been interested in trying out a standing desk for a while now. I found this post http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html a few weeks ago and finally made the trip out to IKEA to get the supplies. It's a great way to try the standing desk idea without too much investment. Full parts list and instructions in link above. Here's my setup after I built it:
